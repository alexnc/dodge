# Create a Basic Phaser HTML5 Game with Canvas and JavaScript (ES6)

The [Phaser HTML5 game engine](http://phaser.io) is not only the
dominant HTML game platform these days but really fun to play around
with and a great way to learn JavaScript in a less boring way. (It also
does not get into the HTML5 DOM, which can be heavy and is another
topic all together).

This tutorial is focused on learning JavaScript ES6 Fundamentals
with the Phaser game framework. As such some things are done the "hard
way" on purpose to introduce the concept before covering it with
a utility function that already exists.
